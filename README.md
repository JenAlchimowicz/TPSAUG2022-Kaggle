# TPSAUG2022-Kaggle

This project aimed to implement an exhaustive model search pipeline using mlflow, to find the best data/model configuration for this challenge. First, I conducted an EDA analysis to familiarise myself with the data and guide my future efforts. Second, I created a search pipeline where several elements were configurable: imputer type, new features to be created, scaling method, feature selection method, type of model and more challenge-specific choices. Then, I run an exhaustive search saving each configuration and it's results in mlflow. This was an iterative process where each new search guided future configuration choices. Lastly, I chose few well-performing but heterogenous models to create an ensable solution.
